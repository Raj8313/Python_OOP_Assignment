# Python OOP Assignment

## Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP? 
A)  It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.OOP models real-world entities as software objects that have some data associated with them and can perform certain functions.

## Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute??? 
A)In Python, inheritance happens when an object is qualified, and involves searching an attribute definition tree (one or more namespaces). Every time you use an expression of the form object.attr where object is an instance or class object, Python searches the namespace tree at and above object, for the first attr it can find.

## Q3. How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object??? 
A) A class is a template for creating objects in a program, whereas the object is an instance of a class.
Instance is an object that belongs to a class.

## Q4. What makes the first argument in a classâ€™s method function special? 
A) This is the reason the first parameter of a function in class must be the object itself.  It is always a reference to the current instance of the class. By convention, this argument is always named self.

## Q5. What is the purpose of the init method? 
A) The __init__ method lets the class initialize the object's attributes and serves no other purpose. It is only used within classes.
